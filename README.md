# Ultracold molecular collisions

Study of collisions between molecules using a classical mechanics approach. In particular, we focus on collisions between a dimer and an atom, similar to what is done in James Croft's and John Bohn's paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0294.pdf. 

This is part of the final project for Harvard's AppMaths 205 course, fall 2017.  

<b>To do:</b>

- Adaptive integration (eg. DOP853) vs RK4
- Numerical methods for Hamiltonian systems (symplectic methods)
- Velocity Verlet
